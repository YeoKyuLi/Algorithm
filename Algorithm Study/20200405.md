# 1. Binary Subarrays With Sum

[site](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-subarrays-with-sum/)

In an array `A` of `0`s and `1`s, how many **non-empty** subarrays have sum `S`?

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: A = [1,0,1,0,1], S = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: 
The 4 subarrays are bolded below:
[1,0,1,0,1]
[1,0,1,0,1]
[1,0,1,0,1]
[1,0,1,0,1]
```

 

**Note:**

1. `A.length <= 30000`
2. `0 <= S <= A.length`
3. `A[i]` is either `0` or `1`.



```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int numSubarraysWithSum(vector<int>& A, int S) {
        unordered_map<int,int> m;
        int res=0, sum=0;

# 2. Find K Pairs with Smallest Sums - E

[site](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-k-pairs-with-smallest-sums/)

You are given two integer arrays **nums1** and **nums2** sorted in ascending order and an integer **k**.

Define a pair **(u,v)** which consists of one element from the first array and one element from the second array.

Find the k pairs **(u1,v1),(u2,v2) ...(uk,vk)** with the smallest sums.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums1 = [1,7,11], nums2 = [2,4,6], k = 3
Output: [[1,2],[1,4],[1,6]] 
Explanation: The first 3 pairs are returned from the sequence: 
             [1,2],[1,4],[1,6],[7,2],[7,4],[11,2],[7,6],[11,4],[11,6]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums1 = [1,1,2], nums2 = [1,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,1],[1,1]
Explanation: The first 2 pairs are returned from the sequence: 
             [1,1],[1,1],[1,2],[2,1],[1,2],[2,2],[1,3],[1,3],[2,3]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3], k = 3
Output: [1,3],[2,3]
Explanation: All possible pairs are returned from the sequence: [1,3],[2,3]
```

# 3. Subarray Sum Equals K

[site](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sum-equals-k/)

Given an array of integers and an integer **k**, you need to find the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to **k**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:nums = [1,1,1], k = 2
Output: 2
```



**Note:**

1. The length of the array is in range [1, 20,000].
2. The range of numbers in the array is [-1000, 1000] and the range of the integer **k** is [-1e7, 1e7].

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int subarraySum(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        unordered_map<int,int> m;
        m[0] = 1;
        int res = 0;
        int sum = 0;

        for(const auto num : nums) {
            sum += num;
            res += m[sum-k];
            m[sum]++;
        } 
        return res;
    }

# 4. Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days - S

[site](https://leetcode.com/problems/capacity-to-ship-packages-within-d-days/)

A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another within `D` days.

The `i`-th package on the conveyor belt has a weight of `weights[i]`. Each day, we load the ship with packages on the conveyor belt (in the order given by `weights`). We may not load more weight than the maximum weight capacity of the ship.

Return the least weight capacity of the ship that will result in all the packages on the conveyor belt being shipped within `D` days.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], D = 5
Output: 15
Explanation: 
A ship capacity of 15 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 5 days like this:
1st day: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
2nd day: 6, 7
3rd day: 8
4th day: 9
5th day: 10

Note that the cargo must be shipped in the order given, so using a ship of capacity 14 and splitting the packages into parts like (2, 3, 4, 5), (1, 6, 7), (8), (9), (10) is not allowed. 
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: weights = [3,2,2,4,1,4], D = 3
Output: 6
Explanation: 
A ship capacity of 6 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 3 days like this:
1st day: 3, 2
2nd day: 2, 4
3rd day: 1, 4
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: weights = [1,2,3,1,1], D = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: 
1st day: 1
2nd day: 2
3rd day: 3
4th day: 1, 1
```

 

**Note:**

1. `1 <= D <= weights.length <= 50000`
2. `1 <= weights[i] <= 500`



```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int counterDay(vector<int>& ws, int mount){
        int cap = 0;
        int day = 1;
        for(auto w: ws){
            cap += w;
            if( cap > mount){
                day++;
                cap = w;
            }
        }
        return day;
    }
    
    int shipWithinDays(vector<int>& ws, int D) {
        auto r = accumulate(ws.begin(),ws.end(),0);
        auto l = max(*max_element(ws.begin(),ws.end()),r/D);
 
        while( l < r){
            auto m = l+ (r-l)/2;
            if(counterDay(ws,m) > D){
                l= m+1;
            }else{
                r = m;

# 5. Course Schedule - E

[site](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/)

There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses-1`.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: `[0,1]`

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite **pairs**, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
             also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The input prerequisites is a graph represented by **a list of edges**, not adjacency matrices. Read more about [how a graph is represented](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/graph-representation/a/representing-graphs).
- You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.
- `1 <= numCourses <= 10^5`

# 7. Check if There is a Valid Path in a Grid

[site](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-there-is-a-valid-path-in-a-grid/description/)

Given a *m* x *n* `grid`. Each cell of the `grid` represents a street. The street of `grid[i][j]` can be:

- **1** which means a street connecting the left cell and the right cell.
- **2** which means a street connecting the upper cell and the lower cell.
- **3** which means a street connecting the left cell and the lower cell.
- **4** which means a street connecting the right cell and the lower cell.
- **5** which means a street connecting the left cell and the upper cell.
- **6** which means a street connecting the right cell and the upper cell.

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/03/05/main.png)

You will initially start at the street of the upper-left cell `(0,0)`. A valid path in the grid is a path which starts from the upper left cell `(0,0)` and ends at the bottom-right cell `(m - 1, n - 1)`. **The path should only follow the streets**.

**Notice** that you are **not allowed** to change any street.

Return *true* if there is a valid path in the grid or *false* otherwise.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/03/05/e1.png)

```
Input: grid = [[2,4,3],[6,5,2]]
Output: true
Explanation: As shown you can start at cell (0, 0) and visit all the cells of the grid to reach (m - 1, n - 1).
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/03/05/e2.png)

```
Input: grid = [[1,2,1],[1,2,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: As shown you the street at cell (0, 0) is not connected with any street of any other cell and you will get stuck at cell (0, 0)
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: grid = [[1,1,2]]
Output: false
Explanation: You will get stuck at cell (0, 1) and you cannot reach cell (0, 2).
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1,3]]
Output: true
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: grid = [[2],[2],[2],[2],[2],[2],[6]]
Output: true
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 300`
- `1 <= grid[i][j] <= 6`



# 8. Number of Closed Islands

[site](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-closed-islands/)

Given a 2D `grid` consists of `0s` (land) and `1s` (water). An *island* is a maximal 4-directionally connected group of `0s` and a *closed island* is an island **totally** (all left, top, right, bottom) surrounded by `1s.`

Return the number of *closed islands*.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/10/31/sample_3_1610.png)

```
Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0],[1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
Islands in gray are closed because they are completely surrounded by water (group of 1s).
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/10/31/sample_4_1610.png)

```
Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,1,0],[0,1,1,1,0]]
Output: 1
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1,1],
               [1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
