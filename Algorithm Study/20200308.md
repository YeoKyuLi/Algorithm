#1. Minesweeper

[site](https://leetcode.com/problems/minesweeper/)

Let's play the minesweeper game ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)), [online game](http://minesweeperonline.com/))!

You are given a 2D char matrix representing the game board. **'M'** represents an **unrevealed** mine, **'E'** represents an **unrevealed** empty square, **'B'** represents a **revealed** blank square that has no adjacent (above, below, left, right, and all 4 diagonals) mines, **digit** ('1' to '8') represents how many mines are adjacent to this **revealed** square, and finally **'X'** represents a **revealed** mine.

Now given the next click position (row and column indices) among all the **unrevealed** squares ('M' or 'E'), return the board after revealing this position according to the following rules:

1. If a mine ('M') is revealed, then the game is over - change it to **'X'**.
2. If an empty square ('E') with **no adjacent mines** is revealed, then change it to revealed blank ('B') and all of its adjacent **unrevealed** squares should be revealed recursively.
3. If an empty square ('E') with **at least one adjacent mine** is revealed, then change it to a digit ('1' to '8') representing the number of adjacent mines.
4. Return the board when no more squares will be revealed.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 

[['E', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'E'],
 ['E', 'E', 'M', 'E', 'E'],
 ['E', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'E'],
 ['E', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'E']]

Click : [3,0]

Output: 

[['B', '1', 'E', '1', 'B'],
 ['B', '1', 'M', '1', 'B'],
 ['B', '1', '1', '1', 'B'],
 ['B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B']]

Explanation:
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 

[['B', '1', 'E', '1', 'B'],
 ['B', '1', 'M', '1', 'B'],
 ['B', '1', '1', '1', 'B'],
 ['B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B']]

Click : [1,2]

Output: 

[['B', '1', 'E', '1', 'B'],
 ['B', '1', 'X', '1', 'B'],
 ['B', '1', '1', '1', 'B'],
 ['B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B']]

Explanation:
```

 

**Note:**

1. The range of the input matrix's height and width is [1,50].
2. The click position will only be an unrevealed square ('M' or 'E'), which also means the input board contains at least one clickable square.
3. The input board won't be a stage when game is over (some mines have been revealed).
4. For simplicity, not mentioned rules should be ignored in this problem. For example, you **don't** need to reveal all the unrevealed mines when the game is over, consider any cases that you will win the game or flag any squares.

# 5. 셔틀버스 - 스터디

[site](https://programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/17678)

카카오에서는 무료 셔틀버스를 운행하기 때문에 판교역에서 편하게 사무실로 올 수 있다. 카카오의 직원은 서로를 '크루'라고 부르는데, 아침마다 많은 크루들이 이 셔틀을 이용하여 출근한다.

이 문제에서는 편의를 위해 셔틀은 다음과 같은 규칙으로 운행한다고 가정하자.

- 셔틀은 `09:00`부터 총 `n`회 `t`분 간격으로 역에 도착하며, 하나의 셔틀에는 최대 `m`명의 승객이 탈 수 있다.
- 셔틀은 도착했을 때 도착한 순간에 대기열에 선 크루까지 포함해서 대기 순서대로 태우고 바로 출발한다. 예를 들어 `09:00`에 도착한 셔틀은 자리가 있다면 `09:00`에 줄을 선 크루도 탈 수 있다.

일찍 나와서 셔틀을 기다리는 것이 귀찮았던 콘은, 일주일간의 집요한 관찰 끝에 어떤 크루가 몇 시에 셔틀 대기열에 도착하는지 알아냈다. 콘이 셔틀을 타고 사무실로 갈 수 있는 도착 시각 중 제일 늦은 시각을 구하여라.

단, 콘은 게으르기 때문에 같은 시각에 도착한 크루 중 대기열에서 제일 뒤에 선다. 또한, 모든 크루는 잠을 자야 하므로 `23:59`에 집에 돌아간다. 따라서 어떤 크루도 다음날 셔틀을 타는 일은 없다.

### 입력 형식

셔틀 운행 횟수 `n`, 셔틀 운행 간격 `t`, 한 셔틀에 탈 수 있는 최대 크루 수 `m`, 크루가 대기열에 도착하는 시각을 모은 배열 `timetable`이 입력으로 주어진다.

- 0 ＜ `n` ≦ 10
- 0 ＜ `t` ≦ 60
- 0 ＜ `m` ≦ 45
- `timetable`은 최소 길이 1이고 최대 길이 2000인 배열로, 하루 동안 크루가 대기열에 도착하는 시각이 `HH:MM` 형식으로 이루어져 있다.
- 크루의 도착 시각 `HH:MM`은 `00:01`에서 `23:59` 사이이다.

### 출력 형식

콘이 무사히 셔틀을 타고 사무실로 갈 수 있는 제일 늦은 도착 시각을 출력한다. 도착 시각은 `HH:MM` 형식이며, `00:00`에서 `23:59` 사이의 값이 될 수 있다.

# 6. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

[site](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)

Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int minPr = INT_MAX;
        int maxPr = 0;
        
        for(int i = 0 ; i < prices.size(); i++)
        {
            if(minPr > prices[i])
                minPr = prices[i];
            else if(prices[i] - minPr > maxPr)
                maxPr = prices[i] - minPr;
        }
        
        return maxPr;
    }
};
```



# 7. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

[site](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/)

Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {

        int max = 0;
        for(int i = 1 ; i < prices.size();i++)
        {
            if(prices[i] > prices[i-1])
            {
                max += prices[i] - prices[i-1];
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
};
```





# 8. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee

[site](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-transaction-fee/)

Your are given an array of integers `prices`, for which the `i`-th element is the price of a given stock on day `i`; and a non-negative integer `fee` representing a transaction fee.

You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction. You may not buy more than 1 share of a stock at a time (ie. you must sell the stock share before you buy again.)

Return the maximum profit you can make.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: prices = [1, 3, 2, 8, 4, 9], fee = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: The maximum profit can be achieved by:
Buying at prices[0] = 1Selling at prices[3] = 8Buying at prices[4] = 4Selling at prices[5] = 9The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.
```



**Note:**

`0 < prices.length <= 50000`.

`0 < prices[i] < 50000`.

`0 <= fee < 50000`.



```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices, int fee) {
        int sell = 0, buy = -prices[0];
        for (auto price : prices) {
            sell = max(sell, buy+price-fee);
            buy = max(buy, sell-price);
        }

        return sell;
    }
};
```

# 9.  Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown

[site](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-cooldown/)

Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:

- You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).
- After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on next day. (ie, cooldown 1 day)

**Example:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,0,2]
Output: 3 
Explanation: transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell]
```

# 10. Reaching Points

[site](https://leetcode.com/problems/reaching-points/)

A move consists of taking a point `(x, y)` and transforming it to either `(x, x+y)` or `(x+y, y)`.

Given a starting point `(sx, sy)` and a target point `(tx, ty)`, return `True` if and only if a sequence of moves exists to transform the point `(sx, sy)` to `(tx, ty)`. Otherwise, return `False`.

```
Examples:
Input: sx = 1, sy = 1, tx = 3, ty = 5
Output: True
Explanation:
One series of moves that transforms the starting point to the target is:
(1, 1) -> (1, 2)
(1, 2) -> (3, 2)
(3, 2) -> (3, 5)

Input: sx = 1, sy = 1, tx = 2, ty = 2
Output: False

Input: sx = 1, sy = 1, tx = 1, ty = 1
Output: True
```

**Note:**

- `sx, sy, tx, ty` will all be integers in the range `[1, 10^9]`.

# 11. Text Justification

[site](https://leetcode.com/problems/text-justification/)

Given an array of words and a width *maxWidth*, format the text such that each line has exactly *maxWidth* characters and is fully (left and right) justified.

You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces `' '` when necessary so that each line has exactly *maxWidth* characters.

Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line do not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.

For the last line of text, it should be left justified and no **extra** space is inserted between words.

**Note:**

- A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.
- Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than 0 and not exceed *maxWidth*.
- The input array `words` contains at least one word.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
words = ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."]
maxWidth = 16
Output:
[
   "This    is    an",
   "example  of text",
   "justification.  "
]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
words = ["What","must","be","acknowledgment","shall","be"]
maxWidth = 16
Output:
[
  "What   must   be",
  "acknowledgment  ",
  "shall be        "
]
Explanation: Note that the last line is "shall be    " instead of "shall     be",
             because the last line must be left-justified instead of fully-justified.
             Note that the second line is also left-justified becase it contains only one word.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input:
words = ["Science","is","what","we","understand","well","enough","to","explain",
         "to","a","computer.","Art","is","everything","else","we","do"]
maxWidth = 20
Output:
[
  "Science  is  what we",
  "understand      well",
  "enough to explain to",
  "a  computer.  Art is",
  "everything  else  we",
  "do                  "
]
```



# 12. Soup Servings

[site](https://leetcode.com/problems/soup-servings/)

There are two types of soup: type A and type B. Initially we have `N` ml of each type of soup. There are four kinds of operations:

1. Serve 100 ml of soup A and 0 ml of soup B
2. Serve 75 ml of soup A and 25 ml of soup B
3. Serve 50 ml of soup A and 50 ml of soup B
4. Serve 25 ml of soup A and 75 ml of soup B

When we serve some soup, we give it to someone and we no longer have it. Each turn, we will choose from the four operations with equal probability 0.25. If the remaining volume of soup is not enough to complete the operation, we will serve as much as we can. We stop once we no longer have some quantity of both types of soup.

Note that we do not have the operation where all 100 ml's of soup B are used first. 

Return the probability that soup A will be empty first, plus half the probability that A and B become empty at the same time.

 

```
Example:
Input: N = 50
Output: 0.625
Explanation: 
If we choose the first two operations, A will become empty first. For the third operation, A and B will become empty at the same time. For the fourth operation, B will become empty first. So the total probability of A becoming empty first plus half the probability that A and B become empty at the same time, is 0.25 * (1 + 1 + 0.5 + 0) = 0.625.
```

**Notes:**

- `0 <= N <= 10^9`. 
- Answers within `10^-6` of the true value will be accepted as correct.

# 15. Path Sum3

You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value.

Find the number of paths that sum to a given value.

The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).

The tree has no more than 1,000 nodes and the values are in the range -1,000,000 to 1,000,000.

**Example:**

```
root = [10,5,-3,3,2,null,11,3,-2,null,1], sum = 8

      10
     /  \
    5   -3
   / \    \
  3   2   11
 / \   \
3  -2   1

Return 3. The paths that sum to 8 are:

1.  5 -> 3
2.  5 -> 2 -> 1
3. -3 -> 11
```

/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.

# 16. Find Median from Data Stream

[site](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-median-from-data-stream/)

Median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value. So the median is the mean of the two middle value.

For example,

```
[2,3,4]`, the median is `3
[2,3]`, the median is `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5
```

Design a data structure that supports the following two operations:

- void addNum(int num) - Add a integer number from the data stream to the data structure.
- double findMedian() - Return the median of all elements so far.

 

**Example:**

```
addNum(1)
addNum(2)
findMedian() -> 1.5
addNum(3) 
findMedian() -> 2
```

 

**Follow up:**

1. If all integer numbers from the stream are between 0 and 100, how would you optimize it?
2. If 99% of all integer numbers from the stream are between 0 and 100, how would you optimize it?

```c++
class MedianFinder {
public:
    // Data type 정의하고
    // AddNum할때 위치를 정해서 넣어주잠
    /** initialize your data structure here. */
    // priority_queue<int> pq;
    vector<int> v;
    int mid;
    MedianFinder() {
    }
    
    void addNum(int num) {
        if(v.empty())
            v.push_back(num);
        else
            v.insert(lower_bound(v.begin(), v.end(), num), num);
           
    }
    
    double findMedian() {
        mid = v.size()/2;
        return (v.size() % 2 == 0) ? (double)((v[mid] + v[mid-1]) * 0.5) : (double)(v[mid]);
    }
};

/**
 * Your MedianFinder object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * MedianFinder* obj = new MedianFinder();
 * obj->addNum(num);
 * double param_2 = obj->findMedian();
 */
