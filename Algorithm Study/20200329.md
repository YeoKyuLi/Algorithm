# 1. Largest Rectangle in Histogram

[site](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-rectangle-in-histogram/)

Given *n* non-negative integers representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, find the area of largest rectangle in the histogram.

 

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/histogram.png)
Above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1, given height = `[2,1,5,6,2,3]`.

 

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/histogram_area.png)
The largest rectangle is shown in the shaded area, which has area = `10` unit.

 

**Example:**

```
Input: [2,1,5,6,2,3]
Output: 10
```





# 2. Find the Duplicate Number

[site](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/)

Given an array *nums* containing *n* + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and *n* (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
```

**Note:**

1. You **must not** modify the array (assume the array is read only).
2. You must use only constant, *O*(1) extra space.
3. Your runtime complexity should be less than *O*(*n*2).
4. There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.



```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int findDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {
        unordered_set<int> s;
        
        for(int i = 0 ; i < nums.size();i++)
        {
            if(s.count(nums[i]))
                return nums[i];
            s.insert(nums[i]);
        }
        
        return -1;

    }
};
```



# 3. Sliding Puzzle

[site](https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-puzzle/)

On a 2x3 `board`, there are 5 tiles represented by the integers 1 through 5, and an empty square represented by 0.

A move consists of choosing `0` and a 4-directionally adjacent number and swapping it.

The state of the board is *solved* if and only if the `board` is `[[1,2,3],[4,5,0]].`

Given a puzzle board, return the least number of moves required so that the state of the board is solved. If it is impossible for the state of the board to be solved, return -1.

**Examples:**

```
Input: board = [[1,2,3],[4,0,5]]
Output: 1
Explanation: Swap the 0 and the 5 in one move.
Input: board = [[1,2,3],[5,4,0]]
Output: -1
Explanation: No number of moves will make the board solved.
Input: board = [[4,1,2],[5,0,3]]
Output: 5
Explanation: 5 is the smallest number of moves that solves the board.
An example path:
After move 0: [[4,1,2],[5,0,3]]
After move 1: [[4,1,2],[0,5,3]]
After move 2: [[0,1,2],[4,5,3]]
After move 3: [[1,0,2],[4,5,3]]
After move 4: [[1,2,0],[4,5,3]]
After move 5: [[1,2,3],[4,5,0]]
Input: board = [[3,2,4],[1,5,0]]
Output: 14
```

**Note:**

- `board` will be a 2 x 3 array as described above.
- `board[i][j]` will be a permutation of `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.







#4.  Base 7

[site](https://leetcode.com/problems/base-7/)

Given an integer, return its base 7 string representation.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 100
Output: "202"
```



**Example 2:**

```
Input: -7
Output: "-10"
```



**Note:** The input will be in range of [-1e7, 1e7].

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    string convertToBase7(int num) {
        bool sign = false;
        string  res;
        if(num == 0)
            return "0";
        num > 0 ? sign = false : sign = true;
        num = abs(num);
        while(num)
        {
            res += to_string(num % 7);
            num /= 7;
        }
        if(sign)
            res += "-";
        reverse(res.begin(), res.end());
        return res;
    }
};
```



# 5. Word Break 2

[site](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break-ii/)

Given a **non-empty** string *s* and a dictionary *wordDict* containing a list of **non-empty** words, add spaces in *s* to construct a sentence where each word is a valid dictionary word. Return all such possible sentences.

**Note:**

- The same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.
- You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
s = "catsanddog"
wordDict = ["cat", "cats", "and", "sand", "dog"]
Output:
[
  "cats and dog",
  "cat sand dog"
]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
s = "pineapplepenapple"
wordDict = ["apple", "pen", "applepen", "pine", "pineapple"]
Output:
[
  "pine apple pen apple",
  "pineapple pen apple",
  "pine applepen apple"
]
Explanation: Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input:
s = "catsandog"
wordDict = ["cats", "dog", "sand", "and", "cat"]
Output:
[]
```
