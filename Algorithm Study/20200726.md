# 1.Ugly Number
[site](https://leetcode.com/problems/ugly-number/)

Write a program to check whether a given number is an ugly number.

Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5.

Example 1:

Input: 6
Output: true
Explanation: 6 = 2 × 3
Example 2:

Input: 8
Output: true
Explanation: 8 = 2 × 2 × 2
Example 3:

Input: 14
Output: false 
Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes another prime factor 7.
Note:

1 is typically treated as an ugly number.
Input is within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1].

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool isUgly(int num) {
        vector<int> arr= {2,3,5};
        int origin = num;
        while(num != 1)
        {
            for(int i = 0; i < arr.size() ;i++)
            {
                cout << arr[i] << " " <<  num % arr[i] << " "  <<  num / arr[i] << endl;
                if(num % arr[i] == 0 )
                {
                    num = num / arr[i];
                    break;
                }
            }
            
            if(origin == num)
                break;
            origin = num;
        }
        return num == 1 ? true : false;
        
    }
};
```

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool isUgly(int num) {
        if(num == 0) return false;

        while(num%2 == 0) num/=2;
        while(num%3 == 0) num/=3;
        while(num%5 == 0) num/=5;

        return num == 1;
    }
};
```

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool isUgly(int num) {
        for (int i=2; i<6 && num; i++)
            while (num % i == 0)
                num /= i;
        return num == 1;
    }
    
    
};
```


# 2.Is Subsequence
[site](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/)

Given a string s and a string t, check if s is subsequence of t.

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

Follow up:
If there are lots of incoming S, say S1, S2, ... , Sk where k >= 1B, and you want to check one by one to see if T has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

Credits:
Special thanks to @pbrother for adding this problem and creating all test cases.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
 

Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 100
0 <= t.length <= 10^4
Both strings consists only of lowercase characters.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool isSubsequence(string s, string t) {
        int i;
        for(i = 0; i < s.size(); i++)
        {
            int location = t.find(s[i]);
            if(location > t.size())
               break;
            t = t.substr(location+1, t.size());
        }
        
        return i == s.size() ?true : false;
    }
};
```

        int pos = 0;
        for(char c : s)
        {
            pos = t.find(c, pos);
            if(pos == string::npos) return false;
            ++pos;
        }
        return true;
    }
};
