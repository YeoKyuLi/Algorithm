#  1. Shortest Path to Get All Keys

[site](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-to-get-all-keys/)

We are given a 2-dimensional `grid`. `"."` is an empty cell, `"#"` is a wall, `"@"` is the starting point, (`"a"`, `"b"`, ...) are keys, and (`"A"`, `"B"`, ...) are locks.

We start at the starting point, and one move consists of walking one space in one of the 4 cardinal directions. We cannot walk outside the grid, or walk into a wall. If we walk over a key, we pick it up. We can't walk over a lock unless we have the corresponding key.

For some 1 <= K <= 6, there is exactly one lowercase and one uppercase letter of the first `K` letters of the English alphabet in the grid. This means that there is exactly one key for each lock, and one lock for each key; and also that the letters used to represent the keys and locks were chosen in the same order as the English alphabet.

Return the lowest number of moves to acquire all keys. If it's impossible, return `-1`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: ["@.a.#","###.#","b.A.B"]
Output: 8
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: ["@..aA","..B#.","....b"]
Output: 6
```

 

**Note:**

1. `1 <= grid.length <= 30`
2. `1 <= grid[0].length <= 30`
3. `grid[i][j]` contains only` '.'`, `'#'`, `'@'`, `'a'-``'f``'` and `'A'-'F'`
4. The number of keys is in `[1, 6]`. Each key has a different letter and opens exactly one lock.



# 2. Valid Palindrome 2

[site](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome-ii/)

Given a non-empty string `s`, you may delete **at most** one character. Judge whether you can make it a palindrome.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "aba"
Output: True
```



**Example 2:**

```
Input: "abca"
Output: True
Explanation: You could delete the character 'c'.
```



**Note:**

1. The string will only contain lowercase characters a-z. The maximum length of the string is 50000.

class Solution {
private:
    bool checkPalindrome(string s, int left, int right)
    {
        while(left < right)
        {
            if(s[left++] != s[right--])
                return false;
        }
        return true;        
    }
    
public:
    bool validPalindrome(string s) {
        for(int i = 0 ; i < s.length()/2; i++)
        {
            int j = s.length() - i -1;
            if(s[i] != s[j])
            {
                return checkPalindrome(s, i+1, j) || checkPalindrome(s, i, j-1);
            }
        }
        return true;
        
    }
};
```



# 3. License Key Formatting

[site](https://leetcode.com/problems/license-key-formatting/)

You are given a license key represented as a string S which consists only alphanumeric character and dashes. The string is separated into N+1 groups by N dashes.

Given a number K, we would want to reformat the strings such that each group contains *exactly* K characters, except for the first group which could be shorter than K, but still must contain at least one character. Furthermore, there must be a dash inserted between two groups and all lowercase letters should be converted to uppercase.

Given a non-empty string S and a number K, format the string according to the rules described above.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: S = "5F3Z-2e-9-w", K = 4

Output: "5F3Z-2E9W"

Explanation: The string S has been split into two parts, each part has 4 characters.
Note that the two extra dashes are not needed and can be removed.
```



**Example 2:**

```
Input: S = "2-5g-3-J", K = 2

Output: "2-5G-3J"

Explanation: The string S has been split into three parts, each part has 2 characters except the first part as it could be shorter as mentioned above.
```



**Note:**

1. The length of string S will not exceed 12,000, and K is a positive integer.
2. String S consists only of alphanumerical characters (a-z and/or A-Z and/or 0-9) and dashes(-).
3. String S is non-empty.



# 4. Sort Characters By Frequency

[site](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-characters-by-frequency/)

Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
"tree"

Output:
"eert"

Explanation:
'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
```



**Example 2:**

```
Input:
"cccaaa"

Output:
"cccaaa"

Explanation:
Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
```



**Example 3:**

```
Input:
"Aabb"

Output:
"bbAa"

Explanation:
"bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
```

``` C++
//https://www.techiedelight.com/sort-map-values-cpp/
class Solution {
typedef pair<char, int> pair;
public:
    string frequencySort(string s) {
        string res;
        unordered_map<char, int> m;
        
        for(char val : s)
        {
            m[val]++;
        }

        vector<pair> vec;
        
        copy(m.begin(), m.end(), back_inserter<vector<pair>>(vec));
             
        sort(vec.begin(), vec.end(), [](const pair& l, const pair& r){
            return l.second > r.second;
        });
             
        for(auto const &val : vec)
        {
            for(int i = 0 ; i < val.second; i++)
                res += val.first;
            cout << val.first << " " << val.second << endl; 
        }
        
        return res;
    }
};

```

``` C++
class Solution {
public:
    string frequencySort(string s) {
        int counts[256] = {0};
        for (char ch : s)
            ++counts[ch];
        
        sort(s.begin(), s.end(), [&](char a, char b) { 
            return counts[a] > counts[b] || (counts[a] == counts[b] && a < b); 
        });
        return s;
    }
};
```
