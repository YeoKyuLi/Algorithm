# 1. License Key Formatting

[site](https://leetcode.com/problems/license-key-formatting/)

You are given a license key represented as a string S which consists only alphanumeric character and dashes. The string is separated into N+1 groups by N dashes.

Given a number K, we would want to reformat the strings such that each group contains *exactly* K characters, except for the first group which could be shorter than K, but still must contain at least one character. Furthermore, there must be a dash inserted between two groups and all lowercase letters should be converted to uppercase.

Given a non-empty string S and a number K, format the string according to the rules described above.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: S = "5F3Z-2e-9-w", K = 4

Output: "5F3Z-2E9W"

Explanation: The string S has been split into two parts, each part has 4 characters.
Note that the two extra dashes are not needed and can be removed.
```



**Example 2:**

```
Input: S = "2-5g-3-J", K = 2

Output: "2-5G-3J"

Explanation: The string S has been split into three parts, each part has 2 characters except the first part as it could be shorter as mentioned above.
```



**Note:**

1. The length of string S will not exceed 12,000, and K is a positive integer.
2. String S consists only of alphanumerical characters (a-z and/or A-Z and/or 0-9) and dashes(-).
3. String S is non-empty.



```c++
class Solution {
public:
    string licenseKeyFormatting(string S, int K) {
        string res;
        for (auto i = S.rbegin(); i < S.rend(); i++)
        {
            if(*i != '-') 
            {
                if (res.size()%(K+1) == K) res += '-'; 
                res += toupper(*i);
                // if(*i >= 97 && *i<=122)
                //     res += *i-32;
                // else
                //     res += *i;
            }         
        }
        reverse(res.begin(), res.end());
        return res;
    }
};
```





# 2. HashMap?



```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

class MyHashMap{
private:
    //vector<pair<int,int>> vec(1000);
    struct List{
        int val;
        int k;
        List* next;
        List(int key, int value) : k(key), val(value), next(nullptr){}
    };
    List* head;
    List* tail;

public:
    MyHashMap() : head(nullptr), tail(nullptr){
    }

    void put(int key, int value)
    {
        List* temp = new List(0,0);
        temp->k = key;
        temp->val = value;
        temp->next = nullptr;
        if(head == nullptr)
        {
            head = temp;
            tail = temp;
        }
        else{
            tail->next = temp;
            tail = temp;
        }
    }
    
    int get(int key)
    {
        List* temp = head;
        while(!temp)
        {
            if(key == temp->k)
            {
                return temp->val;
            }
            temp = temp->next;
        }
        return -1;
    }
    
    void remove(int key)
    {
        List *cur = new List(0,0);
        List *pre = new List(0,0);
        cur = head;
        
        while(cur->next != nullptr)
        {
            pre = cur;
            cur = cur->next;
            if(key == cur->k)
            {
                break;
            }
        }
        pre->next = cur->next;
        delete cur;
    }
    
};
```
