# 1. Max Consecutive Ones III

[site](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones-iii/)

Given an array `A` of 0s and 1s, we may change up to `K` values from 0 to 1.

Return the length of the longest (contiguous) subarray that contains only 1s. 

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: A = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], K = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: 
[1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: A = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], K = 3
Output: 10
Explanation: 
[0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.
```

 

**Note:**

1. `1 <= A.length <= 20000`
2. `0 <= K <= A.length`
3. `A[i]` is `0` or `1` 

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int longestOnes(vector<int>& A, int K) {
        int res = 0, left = 0, cnt =0;

        for(int right = 0; right < A.size(); right++)
        {
            if(A[right] == 0)
                cnt++;
            
            while(cnt > K)
            {
                if(A[left++] == 0)
                    cnt--;
            }
                       
            res = max(res, right - left + 1);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```


# 2. Boats to Save People

[site](https://leetcode.com/problems/boats-to-save-people/)

The `i`-th person has weight `people[i]`, and each boat can carry a maximum weight of `limit`.

Each boat carries at most 2 people at the same time, provided the sum of the weight of those people is at most `limit`.

Return the minimum number of boats to carry every given person. (It is guaranteed each person can be carried by a boat.)

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: people = [1,2], limit = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 boat (1, 2)
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: people = [3,2,2,1], limit = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 boats (1, 2), (2) and (3)
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: people = [3,5,3,4], limit = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: 4 boats (3), (3), (4), (5)
```

**Note**:

- `1 <= people.length <= 50000`
- `1 <= people[i] <= limit <= 30000`



```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int numRescueBoats(vector<int>& people, int limit) {

        sort(people.rbegin(), people.rend());
        for(auto a : people)
            cout << a << " ";
        int right = people.size()-1, left = 0;
        
        while(left <= right)
        {
            if(people[left] + people[right] <= limit) right--; 
            left++;
        }

        return left;
    }
};
```
